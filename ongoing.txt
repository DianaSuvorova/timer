1. So far I am setting React and jQuery in app as global vars..
Maybe needs a better approach. Alternatively I need to require them on every page

Known issues:
  Gulp:
    cleanDev works when an only task executed and doesn't as part of prod task

TODO:
  make gulp error on react error;
  smthng going on with gulp watch css
  react-router mb fix hash  location
